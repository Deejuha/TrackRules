# TrackRules

Small tool to help you stay on the track with Track&amp;Field rules.

## Rationale

[World Athletic rule books](https://www.worldathletics.org/about-iaaf/documents/book-of-rules)
updates in irregular way, also there is no alternative way to get all of those documents updated
than check and click all of those documents.

## How it works?

TrackRules searches for rule books and simply downloads it.

## Prerequisites

-   Trackrules uses Selenium with Google Chrome web browser, hence download
    chromium web driver and add it into your `PATH`.
-   Python environment
